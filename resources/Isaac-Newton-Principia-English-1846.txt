True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed

impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared,

Therefore, in a system of bodies where there is neither any mutual action
among themselves, nor any foreign force impressed upon them from without,

and which consequently move uniformly in right lines, the common centre of
gravity of them all is either at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line.
Moreover, in a system of two bodies mutually acting upon each other,
and the common centre of
gravity
of both are reciprocally as the bodies, the relative motions of those bodies,
whether of approaching to or of receding from that centre, will be equal
among themselves. Therefore since the changes which happen to motions

since the distances between their centres

are equal and directed to contrary parts, the common centre of those bodies,
by their mutual action between themselves, is neither promoted nor re

Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math
ematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments.
By the first
two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the de

with both, unless so far as these motions are a

changed but as the magnitudes of those quantities are changed, by which
the position of the intersecting line is determined.
Wherefore since those
quantities after every revolution return to their first magnitudes, the equa
tion will return to its first form
and consequently one and the same
;

equation will exhibit all the intersections, and will therefore have an infi
nite number of roots, by which they may be all exhibited.
And therefore
the intersection of a right line with a spiral cannot be universally found by
finite equation ; and of consequence there is no oval figure whose area,

any

cut off by right lines at pleasure, can be universally exhibited by an^
such equation.

By the same argument, if the interval of the pole and point by which
the spiral is described is taken proportional to that part of the perimeter
of the oval which is cut off, it may be proved that the length of the peri
meter cannot be universally exhibited by any finite equation. But here I

Tf three bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances

two towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares,
of the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; I say,
that the interior of the tivo revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the

I tried this

motion of the pendulum, and continued it longer. The experiments made

The first time I made it, the hook being weak, the full box was retarded

the surface of the earth, their weights will be one to another reciprocally as
their distances from the centre.
And. by the same argument, the weights in
other places round the whole surface of the earth are reciprocally as the
distances of the places from the centre

As the comets were placed by astronomers above the moon, because

and perhaps retrograde, if the earth is in the other side of its orbit. And

these appearances proceed chiefly from the diverse situations which the

THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES

[BOOK

JJI,

The

near approach of the comets is farther confirmed from the
light of
heads; for the light of a celestial body, illuminated by the sun, and
receding to remote parts, is diminished in the quadruplicate proportion of
the distance; to wit, in one
duplicate proportion, on account of the increase
of the distance from the sun, and in another
duplicate proportion, on ac
count of the decrease of the
apparent diameter. Wherefore if both the
tb.eir

quantity of light and the apparent diameter of a comet are given, its dis
tance will be also given,
by taking the distance of the comet to the distance
of ;i planet in the direct
proportion of their diameters and the reciprocal
subduplicate proportion of their lights.
Thus, in the comet of the year
1682, Mr. Flamsted observed with a telescope of 16 feet, and measured

with a micrometer, the least diameter of its head 2

or star in the middle of the head

but in the
light and splendor of its head it surpassed that of the comet in the year
1680 and might be compared with the stars of the lirst or second

Since, then, the diameters of the heads of the
comets seldom exceed 8 or 12 ; and the diameter of the nucleus or central

star is but about a tenth or perhaps fifteenth part of the diameter of the
head, it appears that these stars are generally of about the same apparent

magnitude with the planets. But in regard that their light may be often
compared with the light of Saturn, yea, and sometimes exceeds it, it is evi
dent that all comets in their perihelions must either be placed below or not
and they are much mistaken who remove them almost
far above Saturn
as far as the fixed stars for if it was so, the comets could receive no more
light from our sun than our planets do from the fixed stars.
So far we have gone, without considering the obscuration which comets
suffer from that plenty of thick smoke which encompasseth their heads,
and through which the heads always shew dull, as through i cloud; for by

But, above all, the thing is evinced from their tails, which

Now one reflects upon the orbit described, and duly considers the other

This was the philosophy taught of old by Philolans, Aristarchus of

and this was the judgment of Anaximander, more ancient than any of
them and of that wise Iring of the Rovnans, Numa Pompilins, who, as

did now and then start up, who would have it that the earth possessed the

the west about the earth quiescent in tk^ centre, some at a swifter, others
at a slower rate.

However,

it

was agreed on both

sides that the

motions of the

whim of solid orbs was of a later date, introduced by Eudoxus, Calippus,

with the notion of solid orbs. The Chaldeans, the most learned astrono
mers of their time, looked upon the comets (which of ancient times before
had been numbered among the celestial bodies) as a particular sort of plan
which, describing very eccentric orbits, presented themselves to our view
only by turns, viz., once in a revolution, when they descended into the

ets,

lower parts of their orbits.
And as it was the unavoidable consequence of the hypothesis of solid
orbs, while it prevailed, that the comets should be thrust down below the

moon, so no sooner had the late observations of astronomers restored the
comets to their ancient places in the higher heavens, but these celestial spaces
were at once cleared of the incurnbrance of solid

orbs,

which by these ob

servations were broke into pieces, and discarded for ever.
Whence it was that the planets came to be retained within any certain
bounds in these free spaces, and to be drawn off from the rectilinear courses,

which, left to themselves, they should have pursued, into regular revolu

The

later philosophers pretend to account for it either by the action of
certain vortices, as Kepler and Des Cartes ; or by some other principle of

impulse or attraction, as Borelli, Honke, and others of our nation for,
from the laws of motion, it is most certain that these effects must proceed
;

from the action of some force or

other.

But our purpose is only to trace out the quantity and properties of this
force from the phenomena (p. 218), and to apply what we discover in some

the observations of Mr. Huygens and Dr. Halley ; though a longer series

is

yet wanting to confirm the thing, and to bring

it

under

a sufficiently exact computation.

For if Jupiter was viewed from the sun, it would never appear retro
grade nor stationary, as it is seen sometimes from the earth, but always to
go forward with a motion nearly uniform (p. 389). And from the very
great inequality of its apparent geocentric motion, we infer (by Prop. Ill
Cor. IV) that the force by which Jupiter is turned out of a rectilinear course,

same argument holds good in Mars and in Saturn. Another centre
of these forces is therefore to be looked for (by Prop. II and III, and the
Corollaries of the latter), about which the areas described by radii inter

From which

distances, together with the periodic times, by the method

And because (as experience tells us) the force of the moon is greater than
that of the sun, the greatest height of the water will happen about the
third lunar hour.
Out of the syzygies and quadratures the greatest tide
which by the single force of the moon ought to fall out at the third lunar
hour, and by the single force of the sun at the third solar hour, by the
compounded forces of both must fall out in an intermediate time that ap

proaches nearer to the third hour of the moon than to that of the sun:
and, therefore, while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the quadra
tures, during which time the third hour of the sun precedes the third of
the moon, the greatest tide will precede the third lunar hour, and that by
the greatest interval a little after the octants of the moon and by like
intervals the greatest tide will follow the third lunar hour, while the moon
is passing from the quadratures to the syzygies.

But the motions which we have been describing suffer some alteration
from that force of reciprocation which the waters [having once received]
retain a little while by their vis iiisita ; whence it comes to
pass that the
tides may continue for some time, though the actions of the luminaries

should cease.

This power of retaining the impressed motion lessens the

And. besides, all the motions are retarded in their passage through shal

It may also happen that the greatest tide may be the fourth or fifth

retarded in passing through shallow places towards the shores: for so the
tide arrives at the western coast of Ireland at the third lunar hour, and an

Of all which we have an example in the port of Batsham, in the king
dom of Tunquin. in the latitude of 20 50 north. In that port, on the

In the channels of rivers the influx and reflux depends upon the current
of the rivers, which obstructs the ingress of the waters from the sea. and
promotes their egress to the sea, making the ingress later and slower, and
the egress sooner arid faster; and hence it is that the reflux is of longer

duration that the influx, especially far up the rivers, where the force of the
is less.
So Sturmy tells us, that in the river Avon, three miles below

sea

and without doubt
Bristol, the water flows only five hours, but ebbs seven
the difference is yet greater above Bristol, as at Carcs/iam or the Bath.
;

This difference does likewise depend upon the quantity of the flux and re
for the more vehement motion of the sea near the syzygies of the

flux

;

luminaries more easily overcoming the resistance of the rivers, will make
the ingress of the water to happen sooner and to continue longer, and will
therefore diminish this difference.

But while

the

moon

is

approaching

to

the syzygies, the rivers will be more plentifully filled, their currents being
obstructed by the greatness of the tides, and therefore will something more
retard the reflux of the sea a little after than a little before the syzygies.
Upon which account the slowest tides of all will not happen in the syzy-

but precede them a little and I observed above that the tides before

north, and its cloud (that is, its tail) was very terrible
